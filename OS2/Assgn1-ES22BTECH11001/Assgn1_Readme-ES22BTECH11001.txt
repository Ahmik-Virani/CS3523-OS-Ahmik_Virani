This Project is made by : Ahmik Virani.  
Roll Number : ES22BTECH11001.  


This assignment is about matrix multiplication using multi-threading

### Input File

The input file is named "inp.txt"
The contents of this are
  1. First we have the size of the matrix : N
  2. Followed by the number of threads : K (This may be seperated by a space or a new line)
  3. Then the input matrix of size N*N : A
## Deployment

I have solved this problem in three ways

1. Chunk method

To deploy the chunk method project on a Linux terminal use

```bash
g++ Assgn1_Src-ES22BTECH11001_chunk.cpp -o Assgn1_Src-ES22BTECH11001_chunk
```
Followed by 
```bash
./Assgn1_Src-ES22BTECH11001_chunk
```

2. Mixed method

To deploy the Mixed method project on a Linux terminal use

```bash
g++ Assgn1_Src-ES22BTECH11001_mixed.cpp -o Assgn1_Src-ES22BTECH11001_mixed
```

Followed by

```bash
./Assgn1_Src-ES22BTECH11001_mixed
```


3. My own method (Extra credit)


To deploy the Extra method project on a Linux terminal use

```bash
g++ Assgn1_Src-ES22BTECH11001_extra.cpp -o Assgn1_Src-ES22BTECH11001_extra
```

Followed by

```bash
./Assgn1_Src-ES22BTECH11001_extra
```

### Output file

All the codes will output the answer matrix into the same file names "out.txt".
