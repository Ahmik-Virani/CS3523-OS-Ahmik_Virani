This Project is made by : Ahmik Virani.
Roll Number : ES22BTECH11001.

A brief description of what this project does:

## Instructions

-   Before running the program please ensure that the name of the input
    file is InFile.txt
-   Also ensure that the first value is the value of N and the second
    value is the value of K, and that they are separated by a space

## Deployment

To host this project on an ubuntu

``` bash
  gcc Assgn1Src-ES22BTECH11001.c -o Assgn1Src-ES22BTECH11001 -lm
```

followed by

``` bash
  ./Assgn1Src-ES22BTECH11001
```

## Features

#### Taking Input

-   Takes two values of input from input file named InFile.txt
-   The two inputs are the values of N followed by value of K.
-   The value of N: we have to find all tetrahedral numbers till N.
-   The value of K is the number of processes.
-   In the input file, the values are separated by a space.

#### Output File

-   Several output files are generated corresponding to all processes
-   It indicates which values are tetrahedral and which are not
